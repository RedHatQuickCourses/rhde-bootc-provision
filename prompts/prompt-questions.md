Create a final course assessment, with questions that require thought and relating concepts instead of just memorization. It is OK to ask about key commands, configuration files, and syntax, as long as the question relates to an important concept instead of to syntax suggar or command/file formatting.

The questions and answers must come from the course book, provided as a PDF file, and must focus on the topics from the topics file, provided as the topics.md file.

Create 10 multiple-choice questions, each with four answers. Only one answer is a correct answer, and the other four are incorrect distractors, which look pausible. Questions should be one to three sentences, and answers should be a single sentence each. 

For each answer, provide an explanation of why it is either a correct or incorrect answer for its question. The explanation should be one to three sentences.

Output the question and aswer sets according to the following template:

---
Q[number]: [question text]

A: [answer text]
Correct: [explanation if this is the correct answer]

A: [answer text]
Incorrect: [explanation if this is an incorrect answer]

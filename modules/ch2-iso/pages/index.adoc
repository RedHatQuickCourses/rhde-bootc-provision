WARNING: Work in progress

== Introduction

This chapter describes the general usage of the bootc image builder tool and how to use it specifically for building custom RHEL installation media.

While it is true that you can use standard RHEL installation media to provision image mode systems, that requires network access to an OCI container registry.
Building a custom RHEL installation image, as an ISO image, by using bootc image builder, enables you to provision disconnected image mode systems from USB media or from local network servers.

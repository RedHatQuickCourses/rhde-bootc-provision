Goal::

WARNING: Work in progress

== Introduction

This chapter describes how to use bootc image builder for building VM images for IaaS clouds and hypervisors, and how to enable services which enable day-1 customization and monitoring of your image mode systems by the target IaaS cloud or hypervisor.

You will see that, while it is possible to perform some day-1 customization by using bootc image builder directly, the common approach would be by using the https://cloud-init.io/[Cloud-init] system service.
